This project aims to identify the best two-week period for a summer holiday in 2023 based on historical weather data for London Heathrow. By analyzing various weather metrics such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, and wind speed, a scoring system is developed to rank the weeks of the summer season. The goal is to leverage data analysis techniques to provide insights into favorable weather patterns and recommend optimal holiday dates.
